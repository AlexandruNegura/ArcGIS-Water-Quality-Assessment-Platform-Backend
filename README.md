# ArcGIS Water Quality Assessment Platform

Me with 2 other colleagues developed a platform to monitor the toxicity of water along the river Mures. 

Using data from national databases we created a platform to visualize and analyze the toxicity and quality of the water. 

This backend exposes the following API's: 
- An user API for registering and logging
- And an email API for sending emails to users
